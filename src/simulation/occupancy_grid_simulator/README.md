# occupancy_grid_simulator
Simulates a robot-centric occupancy grid from a static obstacle map for use in simulation, replacing
a real perception stack. Loads a JSON map file describing the environment, then publishes a
local occupancy grid around the robot at a fixed rate based on the robot's current pose.

## Map File Format
The map file is a JSON file with the following structure:
```json
{
  "resolution_m": 0.1,
  "obstacles": [[x0, y0], [x1, y1], ...]
}
```
- `resolution_m` - cell size in meters
- `obstacles` - list of `[x, y]` cell indices (integers) that are occupied

## Subscribed Topics
- `odom` (`nav_msgs/Odometry`) - Robot pose in the map frame

## Published Topics
- `occupancy_grid` (`nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid`) - Robot-centric occupancy grid stamped in `base_frame_id`, published 
periodically
- `occupancy_grid/ground_truth` (`nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid`) - Full static obstacle map in `map` frame

The `occupancy_grid/ground_truth` topic uses a non-default QoS profile:
| Setting | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Reliability | `RELIABLE` | Guaranteed delivery |
| Durability | `TRANSIENT_LOCAL` | Late-joining subscribers immediately receive the last published state |
| History | `KEEP_LAST` (depth 1) | Only the most recent message is retained |

Subscribers to `occupancy_grid/ground_truth` **must use a compatible QoS** (`RELIABLE` + `TRANSIENT_LOCAL`) or they will
not receive the latched message on connect. A subscriber with default QoS (`BEST_EFFORT` or `VOLATILE`) will silently
receive nothing. In code, use `utils.qos.LATCHED`. In RViz, set the topic's **Durability Policy** to `Transient Local`.

## Grid Conventions
Follows the standard [`nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid`](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/nav_msgs/msg/OccupancyGrid.html) 
conventions:
- Row major, +x forward, +y left of robot
- `info.origin` is the bottom-left corner of the grid in the robot frame
- Cell values: `0` = free, `100` = occupied

The robot-centric grid is sized `width_m × height_m` centered such that the robot sits at
`(-offset_x_m, -offset_y_m)` within the grid (by default, horizontally centered and offset
forward so the grid extends mostly in front of the robot).

## Config Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `map_file_path` | `str` | required | Path to the JSON map file |
| `width_m` | `float` | `5.0` | Width of the published robot-centric grid (m, x-axis) |
| `height_m` | `float` | `5.0` | Height of the published robot-centric grid (m, y-axis) |
| `offset_x_m` | `float` | `0.0` | X offset of the grid origin from the robot (m) |
| `offset_y_m` | `float` | `-2.5` | Y offset of the grid origin from the robot (m) |
| `map_frame_id` | `str` | `map` | TF frame ID for the map frame |
| `base_frame_id` | `str` | `base_link` | TF frame ID stamped on the published occupancy grid, matching what a real perception stack would use |
| `ground_truth_base_frame_id` | `str` | `base_link_ground_truth` | TF frame ID for the true robot pose, used to generate grid cell positions |
| `publish_period_s` | `float` | `0.03` | Publish period for the robot-centric occupancy grid (s) |
