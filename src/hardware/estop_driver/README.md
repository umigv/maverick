# estop_driver
Reads from the serial e-stop device and atomically writes its state to `estop_file_path`. All other nodes read that file
directly to determine whether the robot is estopped.

Does not publish the e-stop value to a ROS topic — this ensures the e-stop still works even if there are ROS network
issues.

## Written Files
- `estop_file_path` - e-stop state; `"1"` = estopped, `"0"` = safe to drive
